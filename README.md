# ShrampyBot - The Golden Shrimp Guild NOW Bot

This is a bot being used and developed actively by the [Golden Shrimp Guild](https://gsg.live) for announcing when streamers on the gsg.live Twitch group and Mastodon instance go live.

This is a "serverless function" running in Go 1.23 on AWS Lambda with DynamoDB.
